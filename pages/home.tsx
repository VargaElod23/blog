          their products. I've been able to help them with the technical
          architecture, the product design, and the development of the products,
          and I've been able to help them with the business development and the
          marketing of the products, which, in turn, left us little to no time
          to spend on giving some love to APE Consulting itself, a decision
          we're trying to right since last summer.

            Lara is a staking and delegation protocol written in Solidity
          </a>
          . It allows users to stake tokens, delegate them to validators, and
          claim rewards, all automatically. Besides making staking a one-click,
          KYC-less process, it helps you earn more via its auto-compounding
          features while it gives the power to opt-in and out of it to the user
          anytime, all of this while helping your TARA tokens remain liquid and
          can be used across a range of DeFi applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides providing a crucial piece of infrastructure for the Taraxa
          ecosystem, Lara is also a DAO, meaning that the protocol is governed
          by its users. The Lara DAO is responsible for making decisions about
          the future of the protocol, including how to allocate the community
          treasury, which features to implement, and how to improve the user
          experience. In the last 6 months, I've been working to deliver the
          first DAO on Taraxa, and I'm proud to say that we're close to launch
          our presale of $LARA tokens, airing March 2023.
